Please find my Github repository for homework 2-3.

Using the attached App.js, index.js, and Page_1.jsx as a starter, create a working router project which routes through all the listed pages, and then add buttons to display "All Pages", "Even Pages", and "Odd Pages".

Provide a link to a working git hub repository to submit this assignment. 

Enjoy!
